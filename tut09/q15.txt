BCNF decomposition

1st Pass
Decomposing Relation R with fds = { ABH → C,  A → DE,  BGH → F,  F → ADH,  BH → GE }
ABH -> C
- Not trivial
- ABH+ = {A, B, H, C, D, E, G, F}, ABH is a superkey
This functional dependency meets the requirements
A -> DE
- Not trivial
- A+ = {A, D, E}, A is not a superkey
Hence, violates the requirements
Decompose R into 
- R1(ABCFGH), fds = { ABH -> C, BGH -> F, F -> AH, BH -> GE} 
(Note, A -> DE is removed since attributes D and E no longer exist
F -> ADH becomes F -> AH since attribute D no longer exists)
- R2(ADE), fds = {A -> DE}

Decomposing Relation R1(ABCFGH) with fds = { ABH → C, BGH → F, F -> AH, BH → GE } 
ABH -> C meets the conditions shown above
BGH -> F
- Not trivial
- BGH+ = {B, G, H, F, A, H, E, C}, BGH is a superkey
Meets requirements
F -> AH
- Not trivial
- F+ = {F, A, H}, F is not a superkey
Hence, violates the requirements
Decompose R1 into
R3(BCFG) with fds = {}
R4(FAH) with fds = {F -> AH}

Relation R2 is in BCNF because for its functional dependency A -> DE, A is a superkey (A+ = {A, D, E})
Relation R3 is in BCNF because there are no remaining functional dependencies
Relation R4 is in BCNF because for its functional dependency F -> AH, F is a superkey (F+ = {F, A, H})

Thus, the BCNF composition of R gives tables with attributes: ADE, BCFG, FAH
