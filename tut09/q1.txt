a. 
What functional dependencies are implied if we know that
a set of attributes X is a candidate key for a relation R?

X -> every single attribute in relation R


b. 
What functional dependencies can we infer do not hold by inspection of the following relation?

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | 1   | x   |
| b   | 2   | y   |
| c   | 1   | z   |
| d   | 2   | x   |
| a   | 1   | y   |
| b   | 2   | z   |

- B -> A does not hold
- B -> C does not hold
- Exercise for the reader


c. 
Suppose that we have a relation schema R(A,B,C)
representing a relationship between two entity sets E and F with keys A and B respectively,
and suppose that R has (at least) the functional dependencies A → B and B → A.
Explain what this tells us about the relationship between E and F.

Entity set E has primary key A
Entity set F has primary key B

A -> B
For every A value, there is one corresponding B value
B -> A
For every B value, there is one corresponding A value

Determine properties about the relationship between E and F
Cardinality

The relationship between entity sets E and F has a one to one cardinality
