Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E,F,G) and
the set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, BC → F, BD → EG, AD → C, D → F, BEG → FA }.
Compute the following:

- A+ 

First step: initialise closure to be {A}
Using A -> B, A exists in current closure so add B to closure: {A, B}
Using BC -> F, BC doesn't exist in current closure, so continue
...
Final closure: {A, B}


- ACEG+ 

First step: initialise current closure to {A, C, E, G}
Using A -> B, add B to closure {A, C, E, G, B}
Using BC -> F, add F to closure {A, C, E, G, B, F}
Final closure: {A, C, E, G, B, F}
