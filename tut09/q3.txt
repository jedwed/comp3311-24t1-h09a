Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E) and
the set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

a. 
List candidate keys of R
ABCDE

A+ = {A, B} missing attribute C D and E
BC+ = {B, C, E} missing attribute A and D
ED+ = {E, D, A, B} missing attribute C

ACD+ = {A, B, C, D, E}

BCD+ = {B, C, E, D, A}
BCD is candidate key

EDC = {E, D, A, B, C} 
EDC is a superkey
EDC is a candidate key

ACD, BCD and CDE

b. 
Is R in third normal form (3NF)?
R(A,B,C,D,E)
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

A -> B
- Not trivial
- A is not a superkey
- B is part of candidate key BCD

BC -> E
- Not trivial
- BC is not a superkey
- E is part of candidate key CDE

ED -> A 
- Not trivial
- ED is not a superkey
- A is part of candidate key ACD

Relation R is in 3NF

c. 
Is R in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?
R(A,B,C,D,E)
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

A -> B
- Not trivial
- A is not a superkey

Hence relation R is not in BCNF
